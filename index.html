    <p>This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to extend the [[mediacapture-streams]] specification.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document contains proposed extensions and modifications to the
    [[mediacapture-streams]] specification.</p>
    <p>New features and modifications to existing features proposed here may be
    considered for addition into the main specification post Recommendation.
    Deciding factors will include maturity of the extension or modification,
    consensus on adding it, and implementation experience.</p>
    <p>A concrete long-term goal is reducing the fingerprinting surface of
    {{MediaDevices/enumerateDevices()}} by deprecating exposure of the device
    {{MediaDeviceInfo/label}} in its results. This requires relieving
    applications of the burden of building user interfaces to select cameras and
    microphones in-content, by offering this in user agents as part of
    {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} instead.</p>
    <p>Miscellaneous other smaller features are under consideration as well,
    such as constraints to control multi-channel audio beyond stereo.</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
      This document uses the definitions {{MediaDevices}}, {{MediaStreamTrack}},
      {{MediaStreamConstraints}}, {{ConstrainablePattern}},
      {{MediaTrackSupportedConstraints}}, {{MediaTrackCapabilities}},
      {{MediaTrackConstraintSet}}, {{MediaTrackSettings}} and
      {{ConstrainBoolean}} from [[!mediacapture-streams]].
      <p>The terms [=permission state=], [=request permission to use=], and
      <a data-cite="permissions">prompt the user to choose</a> are defined in
      [[!permissions]].</p>    </p>

  <section id="camera and microphone picker">
    <h2>In-browser camera and microphone picker</h2>
    <p>The existing {{MediaDevices/enumerateDevices()}} function exposes camera
    and microphone {{MediaDeviceInfo/label}}s to let applications build
    in-content user interfaces for camera and microphone selection. Applications
    have had to do this because {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} did not offer a
    web compatible in-agent device picker. This specification aims to rectify
    that.</p>
    <p>Due to the significant fingerprinting vector caused by device
    {{MediaDeviceInfo/label}}s, and the well-established nature of the existing
    APIs, the scope of this particular effort is limited to removing
    {{MediaDeviceInfo/label}}, leaving the overall constraints-based model
    intact. This helps ensure a migration path more viable than to a
    less-powerful API.</p>
    <p>This specification augments the existing {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}}
    function instead of introducing a new less-powerful API to compete with it,
    for that reason as well.</p>
    <section id="new getusermedia semantics">
      <h3>getUserMedia "user-chooses" semantics</h3>
      <p>This specification introduces
      slightly altered semantics to the {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}}
      function called <code>"user-chooses"</code> that guarantee a picker will
      be shown to the user in cases where the user agent would otherwise choose
      for the user (that is: when application constraints do not narrow down
      the choices to a single device). This is orthoginal to permission, and
      offers a better and more consistent user experience across applications
      and user agents.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, since the <code>"user-chooses"</code> semantics may
      produce user agent prompts at different times and in different situations
      compared to the old semantics, they are somewhat incompatible with
      expectations in some existing web applications that tend to call
      {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} repeatedly and lazily instead of using
      e.g. <code>stream.clone()</code>.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="web compatibility">
      <h3>Web compatibility and migration</h3>
      <p>User agents are encouraged to provide the new semantics as opt-in
      initially for web compatibility. User agents MUST deprecate (remove)
      {{MediaDeviceInfo/label}} from {{MediaDeviceInfo}} over time, though specific migration strategies
      are left to user agents. User agents SHOULD migrate to offering the new
      semantics by default (opt-out) over time.</p>
      <p>Since the constraints-model remains intact, web compatibility problems
      are expected to be limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sites that never migrated show e.g. "Camera 1", "Camera 2" etc.
          instead of descriptive device labels
        </li>
        <li>
          Sites with no device management strategy provoke a picker in the
          user agent every visit for users with more than a singular choice
          of camera or microphone (a feature of sorts)
        </li>

            <p>Let <var>mediaDevices</var> be the object on which this method was

            otherwise.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Replace step 6.5.1. of the {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}}
            algorithm in its entirety with the following two steps:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Let <var>descriptor</var> be a {{PermissionDescriptor}}
                with its {{PermissionDescriptor/name}} member set to the permission name
                associated with <var>kind</var> (e.g. {{PermissionName/"camera"}} for
                <code>"video"</code>, {{PermissionName/"microphone"}} for <code>"audio"</code>), and,
                optionally, consider its {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}} member set to any appropriate

              </li>
              <li>

                is greater than <code>1</code> and
                <var>semantics</var> is <code>"user-chooses"</code>,
                then <a>prompt the user to choose</a> a device with
                <var>descriptor</var>, resulting in provided media.
                Otherwise, <a>request permission to use</a> a
                device with <var>descriptor</var>, while considering
                all devices being attached to a live and
                <a>same-permission</a> MediaStreamTrack in the current
                [=browsing
                context=] to mean having permission status {{PermissionState/"granted"}},
                resulting in provided media.</p>
                <p><dfn>Same-permission</dfn> in this context means a
                {{MediaStreamTrack}} that required the same level of
                permission to obtain as what is being requested.</p>
                <p>When asking the user’s permission, the user agent
                MUST disclose whether permission will be granted only to
                the device chosen, or to all devices of that
                <var>kind</var>.</p>
                <p>Let <var>track</var> be the provided media, which
                MUST be precisely one track of type <var>kind</var> from
                <var>finalSet</var>. If <var>semantics</var> is
                <code>"browser-chooses"</code> then the decision of
                which track to choose from <var>finalSet</var> is up
                to the User Agent, which MAY use the value of the computed
                "fitness distance" from the <a href=
                "https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/#dfn-selectsettings">
                SelectSettings</a>
                algorithm, the value of <var>semanticsPresent</var>,
                or any other internally-available information about
                the devices, as inputs to its decision.
                If <var>semantics</var> is <code>"user-chooses"</code>,
                and the application has not narrowed down the choices
                to one, then the user agent MUST ask the user to make
                the final selection.</p>
                <p>Once selected, the source of the
                {{MediaStreamTrack}} MUST NOT change.</p>
                <p>User Agents are encouraged to default to or present
                a default choice based primarily on fitness distance,
                and secondarily on the user's primary or system default
                device for <var>kind</var> (when possible). User Agents
                MAY allow users to use any media source, including
                pre-recorded media files.</p>

    <h3>Transferable MediaStreamTrack</h3>
    <div>
      <p>A {{MediaStreamTrack}} is a <a data-cite="!HTML/#transferable-objects">transferable object</a>.
      This allows manipulating real-time media outside the context it was requested or created in,
      for instance in workers or third-party iframes.</p>
      <p>To preserve the existing privacy and security infrastructure, in particular for capture tracks,
      the track source lifetime management remains tied to the context that created it.
      The transfer algorithm MUST ensure the following behaviors:</p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>The context named <var>originalContext</var> that created a track named <var>originalTrack</var> remains in control

          <li>
            <p>In particular, <var>originalContext</var> remains the proxy to privacy indicators of <var>trackSource</var>.
            <var>transferredTrack</var> or any of its clones are considered as tracks using <var>trackSource</var>

          <li><p>When <var>originalContext</var> goes away, <var>trackSource</var> gets ended, thus <var>transferredTrack</var> gets ended.</p></li>
          <li><p>When <var>originalContext</var> would have muted/unmuted <var>originalTrack</var>, <var>transferredTrack</var> gets muted/unmuted.</p></li>
          <li><p>If <var>transferredTrack</var> is cloned in <var>transferredTrackClone</var>, <var>transferredTrackClone</var> is tied to <var>trackSource</var>.
          It is not tied to <var>originalTrack</var> in any way.</p></li>
          <li><p>If <var>transferredTrack</var> is transferred into <var>transferredAgainTrack</var>, <var>transferredAgainTrack</var> is tied to <var>trackSource</var>.

    <h3>MediaStreamTrack capture stats</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        On camera and screenshare tracks, video frame counters allow the application
        to tell what the frame rate is, which may be lower than the target
        {{MediaTrackSettings/frameRate}}. For example, if the track is sourced
        from a camera then the production of frames could be slowed down if it's
        dark or frames could be dropped if the system is CPU starved. This could
        impact the total number of frames produced by the source and impact how
        many frames are delivered, discarded or dropped for other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        On microphone tracks, audio capture stats allow the application to tell
        quality related metrics such as capture delay and audio glitches due to
        dropped audio frames.

      <p>If a {{MediaStreamTrack}} is sourced from <code>getUserMedia()</code>
      or <code>getDisplayMedia()</code> and {{MediaStreamTrack/kind}} is
      <code>"video"</code>, the user agent is required to count each video frame
      from its source as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A frame is considered
          <dfn data-lt="delivered video frames">delivered</dfn> if it either was
          delivered to a sink or would have been delivered to a sink, if one was
          connected. This is a subset of [= total video frames =] and it is
          incremented at the same time as [= total video frames =].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A frame is considered
          <dfn data-lt="discarded video frames">discarded</dfn> if it was discarded in
          order to achieve the target {{MediaTrackSettings/frameRate}}.
          This is a subset of [= total video frames =] and it is incremented at the
          same time as [= total video frames =].</p>

        <li>
          <p>The <dfn data-lt="total video frames">total</dfn> number of frames that
          have been processed by this source, meaning it is known whether the
          frame was considered delivered, discarded or dropped for any other
          reason. The number of dropped frames for various unknown reasons can
          be calculated by subtracting [= delivered video frames =] and
          [= discarded video frames =] from [= total video frames =].</p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>If the track is unmuted and enabled and the source is backed by
            a camera, total video frames is incremented by frames produced by the

          dropped prior to being processed by this source, in milliseconds.</p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>Because audio capture devices produce audio in real-time, audio
            frames may be dropped if not processed in a timely manner.</p>

        <li>

        <li>
          <p>The <dfn data-lt="total audio capture delay">total audio capture

              <p>Compressed pixel formats often need to be decoded, for instance

              The user agent SHOULD label compressed pixel formats that incur
              significant power penalty when decoded as power inefficient. The
              labeling is up to the user agent, but decoding MJPEG in software
              is an example of an expensive mode. Pixel formats that have not

    <h2>Exposing MediaStreamTrack source background blur support</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Some platforms or User Agents may provide built-in support for background blurring of video frames, in particular for camera video streams.
         Web applications may either want to control or at least be aware that background blur is applied at the source level.
         This may for instance allow the web application to update its UI or to not apply background blur on its own.
         For that reason, we extend {{MediaStreamTrack}} with the following properties.
      </p>

    <h2>Exposing MediaStreamTrack source automatic face framing support</h2>
    <p>Some platforms or User Agents may provide built-in support for automatic
       continuous framing based on the position of human faces within the field
       of view, in particular for camera video streams.
       Web applications may either want to control or at least be aware that
       automatic continuous human face framing is applied at the source level.
       This may for instance allow the web application to update its UI or to
       not apply human face framing on its own.
       For that reason, we extend {{MediaStreamTrack}} with the following
       properties.

      <h3>Processing considerations</h3>

      <p>When the "faceFraming" setting is set to <code>false</code> by

    <h2>VoiceIsolation constraint</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Some platforms offer functionality for voice isolation:
      Attempting to remove all parts of an audio track that do not
      correspond to a human voice. Some platforms even attempt to
      remove extraneous voices, leaving the "main voice" as the
        dominant component of the audio. The exact methods used may
      vary between implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This constraint permits the platform to turn on that functionality,
        with the desired result being that the "main voice" in the audio
        signal is the dominant component of the audio.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will have large effects on audio that is presented for
        other reasons than to transmit voice (for instance music or
        ambient noises), so needs to be off by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        This constraint is a stronger version of noise cancellation,
        which means that if the "noiseSuppression" constraint is set
        to false and "voiceIsolation" is set to true, the value of
        "noiseCancellation" will be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        This constraint has no such relationship with any other
        constraint; in particular it does not affect echoCancellation.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The WebIDL changes are the following:
        <pre class="idl">
partial dictionary MediaTrackSupportedConstraints {
  boolean voiceIsolation = true;
};

partial dictionary MediaTrackConstraintSet {
  ConstrainBoolean voiceIsolation;
};

partial dictionary MediaTrackSettings {
  boolean voiceIsolation;
};

partial dictionary MediaTrackCapabilities {
  sequence&lt;boolean&gt; voiceIsolation;
};
        </pre>
        </p>
      <h4>Processing considerations</h4>
      <p>
        When the "voiceIsolation" setting is set to <code>true</code> by the
        <a>ApplyConstraints algorithm</a>, the UA
        will attempt to remove the components of the audio track that
        do not correspond to a human voice. If a dominant voice can be
        identified, the UA will attempt to enhance that voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the "voiceIsolation" constraint setting is set to <code>false</code>
        by the <a>ApplyConstraints algorithm</a>, the UA will process the
        audio according to other settings in its normal fashion.

    <h2>Exposing change of MediaStreamTrack configuration</h2>
